            Warehouse analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing and
            interpreting data from warehouse operations in order to improve
            efficiency, productivity and profitability. This can include data on
            inventory levels, shipping and receiving, labor productivity,
            equipment utilization, and more. The use of warehouse analytics can
            help warehouse managers make data-driven decisions, identify areas
            for improvement, and track the success of implemented changes. Some
            key metrics that are commonly tracked in warehouse analytics include
            inventory turnover rate, order fill rate, and picking accuracy.
