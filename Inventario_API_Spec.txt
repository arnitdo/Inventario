>> Routes <<

// Assume all API routes are prefixed with /api/ \\
// It's best to keep frontend routing the same (using React-Router), just skip the /api/ part and keep the segments same \\
// e.g /orgs/:orgId/ -> /orgs/:orgId/ \\
// Administrator (Create + Modify other users) or Employee (No admin perms) \\

1. Each organizational entity is addressed using an organization ID (orgId)

2. Each human entity within an organization is referred to as a "User"

3. Users can be of two authorization levels :
	- Administrator : Can modify other users as well as stocks
	- Employee		: Cannot modift other users, but can modify stocks 

4. Each physical warehouse within an organization is addressed using a warehouse ID (warehouseId)

5. Each product within the company is referred using a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU: skuId)

6. SKUs are required to be unique within an organization. A SKU is a product template, not a physical entity

7. Each item (physical, non addressable entity) must belong to a warehouse

8. Stocks inside a warehouse can be addressed by their corresponding SKU ID, each stock is assumed to be the same as others in the SKU family
	- e.g, If there are three boxes of SKU HCK-BOX-1, you cannot select which box to remove from the stock
	- Each box is assumed to be the same as the other two
	- Any box from the corresponding SKU lot is assumed to be removed
	
9. Stock transfers (W2W) can only be performed within organizations.
